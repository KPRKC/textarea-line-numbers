# Textarea with Line Numbers

<p align="center"> <i>I'm definitely not very good at naming projects</i> </p>

This is a simple script to add dynamic line numbers to a textarea. By adding `tln.js` and `tln.css` (or their corresponding minified versions) to an HTML file and then calling the `append_line_numbers( id )` function, the `<textarea>` with the specified ID will be *numberifiedâ„¢*.

Here's a screenshot of what it looks like:
